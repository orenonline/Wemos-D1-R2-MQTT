# Wemos-D1-R2-MQTT
Using wemos D1 R2 to send and receive MQTT data

All the .zip files are libraries.  You can import it into your Arduino IDE.
The .ino is the Arduino file.  Here, i hardcode the Voltage and Temperature just for testing purposes.
Wemos-D1-R2-MQTT-NodeRed.txt is for Node Red flow.

The libraries and code here also can be used on NodeMCU.

My setup is depicted like the picture Wemos-Relay.jpg 
So, altogether i have 4 relays to be controlled over network.
